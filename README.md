This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is another of my FreeCodeCamp projects "Drum Machine". Its main function is that clicking or pressing on a key activates a sound and a string with its respective name on the display.

If you want you can see in the following [link](https://luismgil.github.io/drum-machine).
